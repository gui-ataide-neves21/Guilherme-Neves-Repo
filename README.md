# Guilherme-Neves-Repository

This repository holds some of the group and individual projects developed by me and my fellow colleagues in the scope of the Masters' Degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics,
with a major in Business Analytics, at Nova Information Management School. All these projects were made in the first year of this Masters (2020/2021 academic year) and they are
divided into the various subjects which I ended completing sucessfully.
